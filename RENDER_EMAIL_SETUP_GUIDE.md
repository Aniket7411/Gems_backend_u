# üöÄ Render Email Setup Guide

## Issue: Email Not Working in Production

**Problem**: Email works locally but not on Render production server.

**Root Cause**: Environment variables not set in Render dashboard.

---

## üîß Solution Steps

### **Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Render**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Login to your account
   - Select your backend service

2. **Navigate to Environment Tab**
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Environment" tab
   - Click "Add Environment Variable"

3. **Add These Variables** (one by one):

```bash
EMAIL_HOST = smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USER = auralanegt@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS = pmsh lmzg pejq fqcz
CLIENT_URL = https://auralaneweb.vercel.app
NODE_ENV = production
```

### **Step 2: Redeploy Your Service**

After adding environment variables:
1. Click "Save Changes"
2. Your service will automatically redeploy
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### **Step 3: Test Email Functionality**

Test the forgot password endpoint:
```bash
POST https://gems-backend-u.onrender.com/api/auth/forgot-password
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "auralanegt@gmail.com"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Password reset email sent successfully! Check your inbox."
}
```

## üîç Debugging Steps

### **Check Environment Variables**

Add this endpoint to debug environment variables:

```javascript
// Add this to your routes/auth.js for debugging
router.get('/debug/env', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    EMAIL_HOST: process.env.EMAIL_HOST || 'Not set',
    EMAIL_PORT: process.env.EMAIL_PORT || 'Not set',
    EMAIL_USER: process.env.EMAIL_USER || 'Not set',
    EMAIL_PASS: process.env.EMAIL_PASS ? 'Set' : 'Not set',
    NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'Not set',
    CLIENT_URL: process.env.CLIENT_URL || 'Not set'
  });
});
```

Test: `GET https://gems-backend-u.onrender.com/api/auth/debug/env`

### **Check Render Logs**

1. Go to your Render service
2. Click "Logs" tab
3. Look for email configuration logs
4. Check for any error messages
