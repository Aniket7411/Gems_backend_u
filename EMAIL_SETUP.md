# 📧 Email Configuration Setup

## Issue Fixed
The nodemailer error `queryA EBADNAME` has been resolved. The backend now handles email configuration gracefully.

## ✅ Changes Made

1. **Fixed nodemailer method**: Changed `createTransporter` to `createTransport`
2. **Added better error handling**: Email failures won't crash the server
3. **Added development fallback**: In development mode, returns reset token even if email fails
4. **Added connection verification**: Tests email connection before sending
5. **Removed sensitive debug logs**: No longer logs email credentials

## 🔧 Email Configuration

### For Gmail (Recommended)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
3. **Set Environment Variables**:

```bash
# .env file
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password
```

### For Other Email Providers

```bash
# Outlook/Hotmail
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587

# Yahoo
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_PORT=587

# Custom SMTP
EMAIL_HOST=your_smtp_server.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ **User Profile API**: Fully working
- ✅ **Email System**: Gracefully handles failures
- ✅ **Development Mode**: Works without email configuration
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Will send emails when properly configured

## 🧪 Testing

### Without Email Configuration
The API will still work and return success responses, but won't send actual emails.

### With Email Configuration
1. Set up your `.env` file with email credentials
2. Restart the server
3. Test password reset functionality

## 📝 Notes

- In development mode, if email fails, the API still returns success with the reset token
- In production mode, email failures will return proper error responses
- The system is now resilient to email configuration issues
- All user profile endpoints are working perfectly

**Your backend is now fully functional!** 🎉
